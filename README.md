# Would You Rather Project

This is the 4th project of Udacity's React & Redux course.

Using the provided starter code, I have built a React/Redux web app.

The app simulate API calls and user authentication, and allows logged in users to view, vote and create polls.

## Use the app

You need to login as a user to use the app, on first load click on the button with the name of the user you want to inpersonate.

The root of the app renders the Dashboard component where polls are listed.

To vote in a Poll that you haven't voted yet, click on the View poll button in the poll card on the app root.

To see Poll votes of a poll you have voted, click on the View poll button in the poll card on the app root.

To add a new poll visit /add or click on the New poll link in the navbar, insert the text of the two options and click on the Save poll button.

To see users rankings visit /leaderboard or click on the Leaderbord link in the navbar.
